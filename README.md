# Genshin Impact Daily Planner

The game Genshin Impact has a rotating list of domains to farm every day, but only certain domains
can be farmed for each character. This creates a problem of the player often not knowing when they
can farm domains for their character, or which days they should be doing it. This planner solves 
this problem by allowing the user to create a team, and then giving them a list of domains that
can be farmed specifically for domains available to farm on that day.

# Pages & Functionality

## Front Page

This is the page that will return a list of domains that can be farmed for the player on that day.

## Your Team

This page shows the user which characters are on their team, and allows them to add up to 3 weapons
for each character, as well as focus or remove characters from their team.

## Create Team

This page desplays all the characters, weapons, and artifacts that are in the game. The user can click
on these characters/weapons to get more info about them and/or add them to their team.

# Take away

The API that was used for this project was a fan made Genshin Impact API, this has taught me a lot
about how to properly stucture APIs, and why having consistancy is important, there were pleanty of
times it felt like I was fighting the API for data, rather than talking to it. It has really opened 
my eyes to problems from the developer side of API interaction.
